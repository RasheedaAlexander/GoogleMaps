  "description": "Jimmie Durham’s Still Life with Spirit Xitle, which first debuted in Mexico City in 2007, is a reference to the eruption of the volcano Xitle 2,000 years ago, which destroyed the city of Cuicuilo. In a clash between the ancient and the modern, Durham used a crane to drop a nine-ton, red basalt boulder onto a 1992 Chrysler Spirit, and even painted a cartoon-like face on the boulder. Don’t miss this thought-provoking sculpture at one of DC’s most popular museums.",
